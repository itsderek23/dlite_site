title:  "SUV Cargo Drawers - some research"

While we store our cooking utensils in our [Scamp Trailer](/2020/07/10/scamp-review.html), it's rare for us to cook and eat a meal inside the camper. It's a pain going in-and-out of the camper to prepare a meal. I'd rather grab these from the trunk of our SUV.

I've started investigated DIY cargo storage solutions for our SUV to give easier access to these utencils.

## The basic design of cargo solutions

Most of the solutions I've found have a low-lying deck (max 12" off the floor) with optional drawers underneath and a fridge slide on top. Here's a sampling of options starting with pre-built solutions:

### ARB ($1k+)

A heavy duty system for off-roading easily runs $1+. Above is an example system from [ARB](https://arbusa.com/storage-solutions/outback-solutions-drawers/) with sliding drawers. We aren't taking our Scamp off-roading, so these feel like more than I need.

### Kitchen System

[Overland Kitchen](https://overlandkitchen.com/) makes an interesting kitchen solution when off-roading. These stack higher than the low-profile deck systems I've seen and include a built-in stove.

We generally prepare our meals on a picnic table so a full kitchen solution accessible from the back of the car is more than what we need.

### Fridge Slide

There are several companies that sell slides for fridges/coolers. These are nice as it is difficult to access the contents of the cooler when it is inside our vehicle. This [fridge slide from Dunn & Watson](https://www.amazon.com/Dunn-Watson-4wd-Fridge-Slide/dp/B072QVCF7C/ref=pd_sbs_263_5/136-1855318-1985705?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B072QVCF7C&pd_rd_r=793e0f66-61c9-45c5-9fc0-34f519ac6fa6&pd_rd_w=j9NVv&pd_rd_wg=WIYXe&pf_rd_p=bdc67ba8-ab69-42ee-b8d8-8f5336b36a83&pf_rd_r=NSGYRXXJRZHZQS40BHHH&psc=1&refRID=NSGYRXXJRZHZQS40BHHH) (pictured above) is about $325 with a capacity rating of 176 pounds.

However, $325 feels like a lot for a convenience item. Our cooler is well under 176 pounds as well when fully-loaded.

### DIY Drawerless Drawer system

My favorite tutorial for creating a simple cargo storage deck is [this one](https://www.patreon.com/posts/simple-diy-with-20207465) from All-Terrian Family. It contains a well-done video of the build, detailed instructions, and a complete list of parts.

This build has a slide out table, which we don't need since we prepare our meals on a separate table. It doesn't have sliding drawers - just a box placed underneath. However, the primary structure seems widely applicable.

## My Custom Adjustments

Starting with the [DIY Drawerless Drawer system](https://www.patreon.com/posts/simple-diy-with-20207465) from above, I'm planning to:

* __Add a drawer with removable bins__ - Most of the drawers I've seen are fully contained within the cargo system. Instead, I'm thinking of having a guide rail-like structure hold several removable bins. This would make it easier to carry utensils back and forth and load our equipment.
* __Add a fridge slide__ - I'm going to checkout the options at our local hardware stores first before shelling out the big bucks for a dedicated fridge slide.
* __Skip the sliding table__ - Not needed as we prepare meals on a separate table.

Off to Home Depot!
