# Hi.

I'm Derek Haynes - currently researching tools to give data scientists more flow when working on machine learning projects. Most recently I released [whisk](https://docs.whisk-ml.org), an open-source data science project framework. Previously I co-founded Scout APM (acquired) and Scout Server Monitoring (acquired).
